																		<p>In today's world, where the global village syndrome has taken centre stage, there still exist voices that are neglected and continuously ill portrayed.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			Media Comms is a group of collaborators, volunteers and participants who are choosing to see beyond the gaps, the statistics and the establishments to 
																			touch the very people that make up our diverse but significant communities; to mirror their experiences and bolster their expressions for inclusive democratic participation in Nigeria and Africa at large.
																			</p>
																		<p>We are a non-profit agency established primarily to improve the capacity of the community to speak for itself, addressing stakeholders, changing narratives, and influencing policies via community-based, responsive and inclusive media participation. <br> <br>We are instituting a learning model that presents every youth and other stakeholders from relevant age brackets as potential community reporters, ambassadors, gatekeepers and purveyors of community narratives that engender, peace, progress and affirmative action.</p>

																		<div class="text-content">

																				In emerging regions, particularly in Africa, there are the urban cities, the metropolis, the suburbia and then there 
																				are the rural towns and villages; those who wake every day, clinging to hope yet being far from its realities and dividends 
																				even as they strive to move to the cities in search of pastures that can be organically "grown" within their communities. This 
																				reality has become the bane for rural-urban migration. The rural communities, in essence, see migration as hope for a brighter future.
																			</p>
																			<p>
																				As a team of community-passionate experts who know that rural towns are not synonymous with poverty in most parts of the world, 
																				except here in the regions of West Africa, we are eager to rewrite the narratives and build better communities through media awareness and education.

																			<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>

																		<div class="text-content">
																			<p>
																				Over the decades, the gap in communities' capacity to express their experiences, and grievances at the grassroots 
																				level has unfortunately expanded. The social disconnect is quite alarming, considering these stakeholders form the 
																				bulk of modern society, especially within the Nigerian polity. They form the living numbers on all election dates; 
																				Women, men and young people year in year out having expectations in administrations and systems that fail them consistently 
																				because for so long, these communities have been without a unified platform and voice to demand accountability and quality governance from their political officeholders.
																			</p>
																			<p>
																				Communities have been kept in the dark and trapped by the weapons of illiteracy, poverty and religious bias by 
																				ill-meaning leaders and stakeholders who seek only personal interests at the expense of their immediate and larger 
																				constituents. These communities can help to build a more inclusive society when they are empowered and equipped to 
																				use their voice creatively and responsibly for democratic participation in governance and overall advancement of their wellbeing.

															Our Approach
														</h2>
														<p style="color: white; font-size: 17px; max-width: 700px; font-style: italic;">The wellbeing of communities is often under-represented in governance, and their conditions largely underreported in the mainstream media.</p>
														<div class="row no-gutters">
															<div class="col-lg-6">
																
																<div style="background-color: white; height: 550px;" class="apply-cont apply-color-2">
																	<p>Africa's rapid growth in mobile telecommunications and internet connections has given rise to instantaneous Citizen and Community Journalism, who can now share information at the touch of buttons. But this has not helped to shape their overall quality participation in inclusive government as these tools have not been deployed creatively or responsibly. 

																		With more sophisticated political and socio-cultural organisations driving their agenda through the same platforms, citizens have become unsuspecting conduits of their agenda and conveyors of fake news. Rather than give a compelling voice, the communities have become innocent victims of activities that do not inspire government engagements. If anything, the government is consistently seeking ways to block these key digital media channels that are now available for the community to exploit in building a voice for a true participatory democracy.

																	<p style="color: white;">Using a combination of advocacy, community relations and community journalism training techniques, MediaComms seeks to build and sustain a vital link that spotlights various communities to their government and other stakeholders in a quest for responsible and accountable interactions. 

																		We believe that the community are real people with an aspiration for good governance and pursuit of better living standards; only a strong voice can earn them a place on the table of inclusive governance. We exist to give reality to these aspirations.
